    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pat dry the duck with kitchen paper to remove any moisture then rub a good layer of fine salt all over (including the cavity).
            Leave it to rest for about 1 hour over a wire rack inside a tray
            </li>

        <li>
            Boil some water in the kettle then gently pour it over the entire duck skin
            </li>

        <li>
            Put Mai Ya Tang, on the surface of the duck.
            You will need hot water to soften and dilute maltose and add a small amount of vinegar (any type). 
            Evenly brush one layer over the entire duck skin.
            Leave to dry in the fridge for 1 hour then brush another layer
            </li>

        <li>
            Put the duck (over a rack and inside a tray) in the fridge without any cover. Keep it there for 24 to 48 hours.
             You can shorten the process by blowing cool air at the duck with a fan if available
            </li>

    </ol>
