    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>marinated in a sweet and savory BBQ sauce and then roasted. It's sweet and salty and has just some nice complexity thanks to five spice
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Hoisin Sauce</li>
        <li>Five Spice Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the pork shoulder (3 lb) into long slices, roughly about 1 inch thick.
             We'll aim to cut each slice with uniform thickness so they cook at the same rate.
            </li>

        <li>
            Afterwards, we'll repeatedly poke each side of each slice with a fork to help the pork absorb our marinade more effectively.
            </li>

        <li>
            Mix the marinade until it's evenly distributed and smooth.
            If you'd like a more rich, red color, you can add a few drops of red food coloring
            </li>

        <li>
            Place the meat into a zip-top bag, pour the sauce in, and massage the pork for about 2 minutes so that the sauce is able to finesse its way into the meat.
             Afterwards, we will push all the air out of the bag and seal it. 
            </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 425° F or 218° C.
            Set up the baking pan by lining the bottom with aluminum foil (so it's easier to clean!), and place the baking rack on top of the foil.
            Using tongs, start laying out the pork on the baking rack and pan.
            Add 1 to 2 tbsp of water to the bottom of the pan to help generate some steam as the char siu cooks, and to help prevent the drippings from burning and smoking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook for 15 minutes and baste both sides with the pork marinade
            Cook for another 15 minutes and baste both sides with pork marinade again
            Cook for 10 minutes and baste both sides with the diluted honey
            And finally, we will turn the heat up to 450° F, cook for another 5 minutes, baste both sides with honey, and let it cool for a few minutes before cutting into it
        </li>

    </ol>
